# Deployment

To deploy the project I have utilised Github Desktop and Github

## My Repository

...

I created a new Github repository and cloned the repository using Github Desktop to develop locally in Visual Studio Code.

Whilst coding in Visual Studio Code, I ensured to save my development at each interval and regularly commit to the respository with commit messages on Github Desktop - this was the preferred method of developing as my Github account had failures when linking to Visual Studio Code. Had this not been an issue, I would have utilised the terminal to make my git commit statements and git push commands.

## Hosting

In order to host the website, I navigated to Github and selected my public repository named 'Second-Milestone-Project' and proceeded as below:

- Settings > Pages
- Source: Select 'Deploy from a branch' from the dropdown menu
- Branch: Select 'Main' and 'root' from the dropdown menus
- Save

The website is now successfully deployed on GitHub Pages once you revert to your repository (initially it will say queued)

# Features

The feautures for the webpage were chosen for easy accessibility and a simple user experience.

## Navigation

For the webiste I opted for a sidebar navigation menu, which remains across each page. In order to do so, the main page has a margin to allow space for this navbar. For smaller screens, the navbar goes to the top of the page
